# IoT-Vending-Machine

**A 3rd Year Group Project from IIT Patna**

This project integrates the Internet of Things (IoT) with a web-site to enable users to order products from a vending machine remotely. Unlike conventional coin-based vending machines, this system utilizes online payment methods for a seamless and secure user experience.

**Features:**

* **Product Ordering:**
    * Users can browse available products on the website.
    * **Select quantity:** Users can choose the desired quantity for each product.
* **Inventory Management:** Real-time inventory tracking with automatic updates upon product dispensing.
* **Payment Integration:** Secure online payments through Razorpay.
* **[In Progress] WhatsApp Bill Message:** Automated WhatsApp messages with order details and payment confirmations.
* **IoT Integration:** 
    * Microcontroller-based control of vending machine mechanisms (e.g., product selection, quantity dispensing, dispensing).
    * Communication between the microcontroller and the web server using an appropriate IoT protocol (e.g., MQTT, CoAP).

**Getting Started:**

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
